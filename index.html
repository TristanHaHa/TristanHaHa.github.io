    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>I graduated as Valedictorian from Granada Hills Charter High with a 4.41 GPA. Since I passed 12 AP Exams (with an average score of 4.5/5), I came into college with 72/180 credits completed. I bypassed 2 intro programming courses with my AP Computer Science A exam score as well as a Credit by Exam offered by my University.</p>
    <p>This past summer (2020), I  learned how to use Git and Github and self-studied Python. I created a board game statistics tracker to practice my skills and also for personal use. It tracks the dice roll probability as well as the average time per player turn (so we all know who's the slowest. I love playing board games: Catan, Pandemic, Chameleon, Codenames, and other classic ones.</p>
    <p>Some of my other hobbies include watching movies, playing chess, playing piano, programming, and learning about Computer Science. I'm very passionate about CS because I think it's actually really fun and relaxing, but also because of the real world problems that CS can solve. I am quick at picking up new technologies and skills. If you would like to contact me for any reason, refer to the section below.</p>
